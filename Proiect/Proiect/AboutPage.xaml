Population.io uses the past estimates for 1950-2010 and the medium population projection up to 2100 and interpolates the distribution daily for the World and for 200 countries (excluding few countries with small population size) and uses the UN’s estimates and projections of life tables for interpolating individual life expectancy by date and place of birth."
